<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>While Amazon Route53 allows you to map a zone apex [<code>domain.com</code>] to an Elastic Load Balancer, you don't always have the ability to control DNS for a zone, or to move it into Route53. Therefore you need a consistent, persistent, public IP that you can map to. This script ensures that the Elastic IP you provision will stay mapped to an active instance within your EC2 Auto-Scaling Group.</p>


<h3>Requirements</h3>
<ul>
 <li>AWS-CLI - <a target="_new" href="http://aws.amazon.com/cli/">http://aws.amazon.com/cli/</a>
 <li>jq - <a target="_new" href="http://stedolan.github.io/jq/">http://stedolan.github.io/jq/</a>
 <li>Pushover API token/user (optional) - <a target="_new" href="https://pushover.net/">https://pushover.net/</a>
 <li>An AWS SQS queue
 <li>An AWS EC2 autoscaling group
 <li>An AWS EC2 elastic IP
 <li>bash and curl
</ul>


<h3>SQS Queue Setup</h3>
<ul>
 <li>Create an SQS queue and set the <code>Default Visibility Timeout</code> to 30 seconds. This script uses SQS "long polling" which means it will continue to poll for a response for 20 seconds. That leaves only a possible 10-second window when a message will arrive before it is detected.
 <li><code>Message Retention Period</code> can be set to something short, 15 mins will work well. These messages are designed to be picked up and acted upon within very short order, then deleted.
 <li><code>Receive Message Wait Time</code> should be set to 0
</ul>


<h3>EC2 Auto-Scaling Setup</h3>
<ul>
 <li>Create your Launch Configuration and Auto-Scaling Group (ASG) as you normally would.
 <li>In the Notification properties of your ASG, create a notification to be sent whenever an instance is terminated. The notification should be pointed to the SQS queue you create above.
</ul>


<h3>Script Installation</h3>
<ul>
 <li>Install both scripts in a directory such as <code>/root/scripts/</code>. (Search the scripts for this path and replace accordingly.)
 <li>Be sure your path to the 'aws' executable is used in the scripts. This is often <code>/usr/bin/aws</code>.
 <li>If you use AWS CLI profiles, specify your profile as needed in the variable.
 <li>Configure all static variables at the top of each script.
 <li>Create an SQS queue and enter the appropriate queue variables into your scripts.
 <li>After creating an auto-scaling group in EC2, create a notification to be sent to your SQS queue upon ASG terminations.
 <li>Set the SQS script to be executed by cron every N minutes. When the SQS polling script detects a message, it will trigger the second script. Polling every 1-5 minutes is recommended.
</ul>


<h3>Pushover Notifications</h3>
<p>If you don't want to implement Pushover notifications upon reattachment, remove or comment out all the curl commands. Or adapt them to your own notifications.</p>
<p>If you do want to implement Pushover notifications to your mobile device, create a Pushover account and get your <code>Token</code> and <code>User</code> keys. These are long and ugly, but will allow the script to send messages via <code>curl</code>.</p>


<h3>EIP Attachment Workflow</h3>
<ol>
 <li>Upon a scale-out event of your ASG (Auto-Scaling Group) new instances are added as necessary. The EIP remains unaffected and in-use.
 <li>Upon a scale-in event of your ASG, when instances are terminated, the script will assist you by ensuring the EIP continues to be attached to a healthy, active EC2 instance. The termination ASG notification will create a message in the SQS queue.
 <li>The SQS polling script, which checks for messages every N seconds/minutes, when it discovers the message waiting for pickup, triggers the secondary script.
 <li>Finally, the fixed-ip script examines the ELB for healthy (remaining) instances and reattaches the EIP if necessary. After completion it both removes the SQS message and sends a Pushover notification via curl.
</ol>
